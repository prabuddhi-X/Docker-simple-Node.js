# Dockerize a simple Node.js application 

## Project Overview
Dockerize a very simple Node.js app using docker on an EC2 instance

## pourpose
The porpose of this project is get an idea of how to install Docker Engine on Virtual Machine and how learn how to write a Dockerfile

## Tools
- AWS EC2
- Docker
- Node.js

## Steps Followed
1. Launched EC2 instance (Ubuntu)

5. Browse application from local windows machne

## Results
It viewed Simple hello world! app successfully

## What I learnt
- The way of create Dockerfile
- Entier Dockerize process simply learnt
- I realized that without 3000 port inbount traffic allow for security group of EC2, It cant be browsed successfully

## Notes
- All resources have been deleted on AWS to prevent costing
- **The Node.js code that I have used this project is generated by ChatGPT**
